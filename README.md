# Project-1-Stage-1

I keep on getting an error message when I try and submit my Sprint 1 Stage 1 Project. This is the error message I keep encountering: 
"The <header>, <main>, and <footer> tags should all be children of the <div> with class page." 
I have tried countless different edits and adjustments but I end up with same message. Please review code and point out what I am doing wrong? Thank you.
